        <h2>§1 – Security of Accounts and Identity Authentication</h2>

        <h3>1.1. Personal Accountability for Account Security</h3>
        <p>
          Every individual person (hereinafter referred to as “the Player”) who establishes, maintains, or otherwise makes use of a registered account for the purposes of accessing the OpenWilds server environment shall bear full, exclusive, and unassailable responsibility for the protection, maintenance, and safeguarding of said account. This responsibility extends to all aspects of account security, including the physical and digital security of the devices and networks used to access OpenWilds. The Player is solely accountable for any and all actions, transactions, and behaviors originating from their authenticated account, regardless of who may have been operating the account at the time.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2. The Player's Obligation to Utilize Robust Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          The Player is obligated to utilize authentication credentials (including, but not limited to, passwords) that are strong, unique, and not reasonably susceptible to brute force or unauthorized guessing. A strong password is defined as one that is a minimum of twelve (12) characters in length, contains a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and is not a common word, phrase, or personal information easily associated with the Player. The same password or a variation thereof shall not be used on any other platform, service, or network.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3. Prohibition of Credential Disclosure and Dissemination</h3>
        <p>
          Under no circumstance shall the Player disclose, disseminate, publish, or otherwise make available their account credentials to any other party. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, direct communication, indirect hints, sharing with friends or family, or providing credentials in exchange for in-game services or items. Any failure to maintain the absolute confidentiality of account access information, whether intentional or accidental, shall be construed as gross negligence on the part of the Player. The Player is advised that members of the Staff will never, under any circumstances, request a Player's password. Any such request should be immediately reported as a phishing attempt.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4. Limitations of Liability for Staff and OpenWilds</h3>
        <p>
          Members of the OpenWilds administrative or moderation staff (hereinafter “the Staff”) are not, and shall not be deemed, liable in any capacity for the compromise, loss, or theft of Player accounts, credentials, or related data. This limitation of liability extends to all forms of loss, including those resulting from phishing attacks, malware, unauthorized access to the Player's personal device, or any other external security breach. The Staff shall, however, endeavor to assist in the recovery of an account in the event of a reported compromise, subject to verification of the Player's identity and at the sole discretion of the Staff. Such assistance is provided as a courtesy and does not constitute an admission of liability.
        </p>

        <h3>1.5. Strict Regulation of Multiple Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          The operation of multiple accounts by the same Player, colloquially known as “alt accounts,” shall be strictly restricted. Such accounts may not, under any circumstances, be used to obtain unfair advantage, evade punitive measures, manipulate gameplay or community processes, or otherwise bypass the intended limitations of the OpenWilds network. Examples of prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:
          a) The creation of alt accounts to circumvent a ban, mute, or other disciplinary action.
          b) The use of alt accounts to farm in-game resources, currency, or items in a manner that bypasses or exceeds the normal rate of acquisition.
          c) The use of alt accounts to manipulate votes, competition results, or other community-driven metrics.
          d) The use of alt accounts to harass, threaten, or intimidate other Players from a different identity.
          The Staff reserves the right to link accounts based on shared IP addresses, hardware IDs, or other technical data.
        </p>

        <h3>1.6. Formal Petition for Permitted Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
          Any exception to the foregoing prohibition on multiple accounts may only be granted upon formal petition to, and express written approval by, the Staff. The petition must be submitted through the designated support portal and shall include, at a minimum, the Player’s primary account name, the name(s) of the additional account(s), and a detailed, verifiable, and non-misleading explanation for the necessity of the exception. The granting of an exception is not guaranteed and is subject to the sole and absolute discretion of the Staff.
        </p>

        <h2>§2 – Conduct of Players and Behavioral Standards</h2>

        <h3>2.1. Mandate for Respectful and Civil Conduct</h3>
        <p>
          All Players shall conduct themselves with respect, civility, and in good faith toward all other members of the community, including fellow Players, Staff members, and external partners. All communication and interaction must be governed by a fundamental commitment to the health, positivity, and constructive nature of the community. Toxic behavior, which is broadly defined as any action or expression that actively undermines this commitment, shall be subject to disciplinary action.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2. Enumeration of Prohibited Behavioral Violations</h3>
        <p>
          The following shall constitute violations of the mandatory standards of behavior:
          a) Excessive or Repetitive Chat Messages: The excessive or repetitive transmission of chat messages (commonly referred to as “spam”), including, but not limited to, the use of continuous capital letters (SHOUTING), repetitive symbols or characters, or the posting of lengthy, pre-written texts (copypasta).
          b) Vulgar, Profane, and Offensive Language: The use of vulgar, profane, obscene, sexually explicit, discriminatory, or otherwise offensive expressions. This includes the use of racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and any language that promotes or references hate speech, violence, or illegal activities.
          c) Harassment, Intimidation, and Threats: Any act of harassment, intimidation, threats of violence, or any form of provocation toward other Players or Staff. This includes, but is not limited to, verbal abuse, cyberbullying, public shaming, or engaging in unwanted, persistent communication.
          d) Harmful Content and Glorification of Self-Harm: Any mention, encouragement, or glorification of self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, or related harmful behavior. This is a zero-tolerance policy. Any content, whether explicit or implicit, that may reasonably be interpreted as a threat of self-harm will be addressed with immediate and severe disciplinary action, and may be reported to external authorities.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3. Regulation of In-Game Content</h3>
        <p>
          Content disseminated by Players, whether in chat, on signs, in item names, or in any other in-game medium, shall remain appropriate and inoffensive at all times. Without limitation, the following shall be strictly prohibited:
          a) Pornographic and Obscene Material: Any sexual, pornographic, or graphically obscene content. This includes, but is not limited to, suggestive builds, explicit item names, and sharing links to such content.
          b) False, Misleading, and Defamatory Content: Content that is deliberately false, misleading, defamatory, or calculated to cause reputational harm to another Player, Staff member, or the OpenWilds community as a whole. This includes spreading rumors, fabricating stories, or publishing private conversations without consent.
          c) Toxic and Inflammatory Expressions: Expressions or actions that may reasonably be considered toxic, inflammatory, or detrimental to the health of the community. Examples include but are not limited to baiting, trolling, provoking arguments, and public displays of negativity intended to discourage or upset other Players.
        </p>

        <h2>§3 – Language Usage and Inclusivity</h2>

        <h3>3.1. Mandate for Inclusive Communication</h3>
        <p>
          In all publicly accessible channels of communication within OpenWilds, including but not limited to Global Chat, Public Channels, and in-game signs, Players shall use language in a manner that promotes inclusivity, mutual understanding, and respect for a global and diverse community.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2. Freedom of Language within Consenting Groups</h3>
        <p>
          Any language may be employed where it is reasonably evident that all participants in a given conversation or localized area understand the same. This applies to party chats, direct messages, and private group channels where all members have explicitly agreed to communicate in a specific language.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3. Default to English in Public Channels</h3>
        <p>
          Where a common understanding cannot reasonably be established, particularly in Global Chat or other public, open channels, the Player is required to default to the English language, or alternatively to a mutually shared language, so as to preserve clarity and order. This is to ensure that all Players have a fair opportunity to understand and participate in the public discourse. The use of another language in a public channel to exclude or intentionally confuse other Players is a violation of this Rule.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4. Unrestricted Private Communication</h3>
        <p>
          In private messages between consenting individuals, the unrestricted use of any language is permitted. However, all private communications remain subject to all other provisions of these Statutes, particularly those related to harassment, threats, and illegal activities. The Staff reserves the right to review private communications if a formal complaint of a rule violation has been made.
        </p>

        <h2>§4 – Regulation of Names, Skins, and Personal Identifiers</h2>

        <h3>4.1. Mandate for Appropriate Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
          All usernames, nicknames, and in-game skins shall remain appropriate for a public and diverse audience. The chosen identifiers must not be offensive, inflammatory, or in violation of any other provision of these Statutes. This applies to all forms of identification, including display names, team names, and any custom item or in-game entity names.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2. Prohibition of Specific Content in Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
          Prohibited shall be any identifier or visual representation which contains, depicts, or references:
          a) Hate-Based Ideologies: Racism, fascism, extremism, terrorism, or related hate-based ideologies. This includes any reference to historical hate groups, the use of symbols associated with such ideologies, or any name that promotes discrimination or violence.
          b) Sexual, Vulgar, or Pornographic Material: Any sexually explicit, vulgar, or pornographic material. This includes suggestive or provocative content, anatomical references, or any identifier that is overtly obscene.
          c) Unauthorized Promotions: The names, links, or identifiers of competing servers, unauthorized services, or cheating software. This includes subtle or indirect references designed to promote external entities.
          d) False Impersonation: False impersonation of, or deceptive attempts to resemble, members of the Staff, official OpenWilds entities, or other well-known community members. Any identifier that could reasonably confuse or mislead another Player into believing a false identity is a direct violation.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3. Consequences and Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
          Any violation of this Section will result in immediate and mandatory disciplinary action. The Player's username or nickname may be reset to a default or temporary name, and their skin may be forcibly changed. Continued or repeated violations may result in a permanent ban from the OpenWilds network.
        </p>

        <h2>§5 – Fair Play, Exploitation, and Honesty</h2>

        <h3>5.1. Prohibition of Third-Party Modifications and Cheats</h3>
        <p>
          The employment, distribution, or advertisement of third-party modifications, cheats, hacks, macros, scripts, or other methods designed to secure an unfair advantage is prohibited in all forms. This includes, but is not limited to, automated tools for combat or resource gathering, fly hacks, X-ray clients, and any software that modifies the game client or its communication with the server to provide an advantage over other Players. A fair advantage is defined as one gained through legitimate gameplay, skill, or effort, while an unfair advantage is one gained by bypassing the intended mechanics of the game.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2. Prohibition of Exploitation of Bugs and Glitches</h3>
        <p>
          Players shall not abuse unintended mechanics, loopholes, or technical irregularities for personal gain or to the detriment of the server or other Players. This includes, but is not limited to, item duplication glitches, bypassing server permissions, or exploiting visual bugs for tactical advantage. Any such exploitation, whether intentional or accidental, shall be considered a serious offense.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3. Mandatory Reporting of Exploits</h3>
        <p>
          All bugs, glitches, and other malfunctions discovered must be reported promptly and directly to the Staff through the designated support portal. Exploiting such bugs, even for a brief period, shall constitute a punishable offense. Valid and constructive reports that contribute to the stability and security of the server may, at the sole discretion of the Staff, be rewarded. The Staff reserves the right to determine the validity and severity of any reported bug.
        </p>

        <h3>5.4. Mandate for Honesty and Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          The Player must remain honest and transparent in all interactions with Staff and other Players. Prohibited shall be the fabrication of evidence, the lodging of false reports, the staging of fraudulent events, giveaways, or competitions, or any other act of deception intended to mislead, defraud, or otherwise harm the community.
        </p>

        <h2>§6 – Regulation of Advertising and External Promotion</h2>

        <h3>6.1. Prohibition of External Promotion</h3>
        <p>
          The promotion of external servers, networks, communities, or organizations is expressly forbidden in any public or private channel on the OpenWilds network. This prohibition extends to any and all forms of advertising, whether direct or indirect, subtle or overt.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2. Specific Prohibited Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
          This prohibition encompasses, but is not limited to, the public or private dissemination of IP addresses, server names, hyperlinks, Discord invite links, social media handles, or similar identifiers that are not directly affiliated with OpenWilds.
        </p>

        <h3>6.3. Formal Process for Approved Promotion</h3>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, content directly relating to OpenWilds, its official community, or a Player's individual experiences on the server may be promoted or distributed, provided that prior approval has been explicitly obtained in writing from the Staff. This process requires a formal submission through the support portal detailing the nature, scope, and purpose of the proposed promotion.
        </p>

        <h2>§7 – Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Protection</h2>

        <h3>7.1. Mandate to Respect Player Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Each Player shall respect and safeguard the personal privacy of others. The sharing of private information without explicit, written consent from the owner of said information is a severe violation of these Statutes.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2. Prohibition of Sharing Private Information</h3>
        <p>
          The sharing, publication, or transmission of private information—including but not limited to real names, photographs, geographic locations, school or work information, contact details (phone numbers, email addresses), and account identifiers from other platforms—is strictly prohibited. This rule applies to information about other Players as well as Staff.
        </p>

        <h3>7.3. Confidentiality of Internal Server Data</h3>
        <p>
          Internal server data, including tickets, chat logs, staff-related communications, and all data related to ongoing investigations, is deemed confidential and privileged. Unauthorized disclosure or publication thereof, including the public sharing of private messages with Staff, shall be punishable by severe disciplinary measures, including a permanent ban from the network.
        </p>

        <h2>§8 – Authority of Staff and Enforcement of Punishments</h2>

        <h3>8.1. Authority of Staff Rulings</h3>
        <p>
          The rulings, directives, and decisions issued by the Staff are authoritative and binding upon all Players. Staff members have been granted the authority to interpret and enforce these Statutes in a fair and consistent manner. All Players are obligated to comply with a Staff member's directive, regardless of whether they agree with it.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2. Prohibition of Public Disputes with Staff</h3>
        <p>
          Public disputes or arguments with Staff members regarding disciplinary actions or other decisions are strictly prohibited and may result in escalated disciplinary measures. All grievances and objections must be handled in a respectful and private manner through the designated appeal system.
        </p>

        <h3>8.3. Formal Appeal Process for Disciplinary Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Appeals and objections to disciplinary actions shall be submitted exclusively through the designated support system. The appeal must be submitted within a reasonable timeframe (typically 30 days), must be polite and respectful in tone, and must contain any new evidence or information relevant to the case. Submitting multiple appeals for the same punishment or spamming the appeal system will result in the immediate rejection of all appeals. The decision of the Appeals Staff is final.
        </p>

        <h3>8.4. Prohibition of Punishment Evasion</h3>
        <p>
          The evasion of punishment through the use of alternate accounts, VPNs, proxies, IP changers, or other circumvention methods is a severe violation of these Statutes. Any Player found to be evading a ban, mute, or other disciplinary action will have all of their associated accounts, and potentially their IP address and hardware ID, permanently banned from the OpenWilds network.
        </p>

        <h3>8.5. No Right to Restitution for Lost Progress</h3>
        <p>
          Under no circumstances shall refunds, reimbursements, or restitution be issued for lost progress, items, or privileges resulting from disciplinary measures. The Player is responsible for their own conduct, and any loss resulting from a violation of these Statutes is a direct consequence of the Player's actions.
        </p>

        <h2>§9 – Ownership of Data and Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h3>9.1. Exclusive Ownership of Server Data</h3>
        <p>
          All data generated within the OpenWilds environment, including but not limited to player inventories, world files, structures, in-game currency, and economic records, shall remain the exclusive and perpetual property of OpenWilds. The Player has no claim of ownership over any in-game assets. OpenWilds makes no guarantee as to the security or permanence of this data. No compensation shall be given in the event of corruption, loss, or deletion thereof, whether caused by technical failure, server maintenance, or any other event.
        </p>

        <h3>9.2. Protection of OpenWilds Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
          The branding, trademarks, assets, and unique features of OpenWilds are protected intellectual property. Unauthorized use, replication, distribution, or modification of said property shall constitute a severe infringement and shall be subject to sanction, including legal action.
        </p>

        <h2>§10 – Legal Responsibility of Guardians</h2>

        <h3>10.1. Guardian Accountability</h3>
        <p>
          Parents, legal guardians, or custodians of Players who are minors under applicable jurisdiction shall bear full legal and moral responsibility for ensuring the compliance of said minors with the entirety of these Rules. By permitting a minor to access the OpenWilds network, the guardian affirms their acceptance of and responsibility for the minor’s adherence to all Statutes.
        </p>

        <h2>§11 – Amendment and Modification of Rules</h2>

        <h3>11.1. Right to Unrestricted Modification</h3>
        <p>
          OpenWilds reserves the unrestricted and unilateral right to modify, amend, expand, or repeal these Rules at any time and without prior notice to the Players. This right is necessary to ensure the Statutes can adapt to new challenges, technologies, and community needs.
        </p>

        <h3>11.2. Public Accessibility of Updates</h3>
        <p>
          Updates to these Statutes shall be made publicly accessible within the community, but no guarantee of direct, individual notification to each Player is made or implied. The Player is solely responsible for staying informed.
        </p>

        <h3>11.3. Ignorance as No Defense</h3>
        <p>
          Players are obligated to remain informed of the current Rules and shall not plead ignorance thereof as a defense for any violation. The act of accessing the OpenWilds network constitutes continuous consent to the current version of these Statutes.
        </p>

        <h3>11.4. Discretionary Interpretation by Staff</h3>
        <p>
          The Staff retains the absolute discretion to interpret and adjudicate matters not explicitly covered by these Rules. In such cases, the Staff’s decision shall be guided by the principles of fairness, community welfare, and the preservation of the OpenWilds environment.
        </p>

        <h2>§12 – Affirmation of Agreement</h2>

        <h3>12.1. Affirmation and Consent</h3>
        <p>
          By accessing, participating in, or otherwise making use of the OpenWilds server, each Player hereby affirms, acknowledges, and irrevocably declares that they:
          a) Have read, comprehended, and fully understood the Rules in their entirety.
          b) Consent to be bound by the Rules at all times and without exception.
          c) Accept full accountability for any and all consequences arising from violations thereof, including but not limited to the loss of in-game privileges, assets, and access to the network.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, let it be enacted, established, and enforced within the realm of OpenWilds.</p>
